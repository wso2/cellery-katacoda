A Basic Cellery Installation (Kuberentes runtime, Cellery Runtime, and Cellery CLI) will start automatically and may take a few minutes to complete. This will set up an environment for demo purposes. In a normal setup, you will have to create your own environment using `cellery setup`. 

Once the installation is completed, run the following command to check that it is properly installed.  
`cellery version`{{execute}}

Great! You now have a running Cellery environment in your online terminal. Let’s proceed to the next steps to tryout your first application on Cellery.
