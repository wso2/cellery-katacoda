We have the Cellery project prepared for you with all the cell files and the source files.  

This sample is structured into two Cells.  
1. Pet-be Cell
2. Pet-fe Cell

#### Pet-be (Backend Cell)

This contains the four components which involve working with the Pet Store data and also the business logic. This Cell has an HTTP Ingress to expose the APIs.

#### Pet-fe (Frontend Cell)

This contains a single component which serves the Portal. The Portal is exposed through a Web Cell which is able to provide SSO and Web Content delivery features.

Take your time and explore the files that are generated for you.

Click on the links below to open the Cell files with the editor. The inline comments will explain about each field and operation.

If you are interested in learning what these containers do, you can find them under the `components` folder in each Cell folder. It contains the Dockerfile as well. You can modify them if needed.
